# Do you know Nada or Â¿sabes nada?

## How does this game work?

This is a trivia game that checks how well the player knows me. I am choosing to make this because I think its fun and I can actually send it to my friends and family to see how they do! Every player will have to answer 10 questions and the game will keep track of the number they get right. There is no real winner or loser, but depending on your score - you will get a response on how well you know Nada.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

This is a trivia game that checks how well the player knows me. Every player will have to answer 10 questions and the game will keep track of the number they get right. If they answer incorrectly, game will inform user of the right answer. There is no real winner or loser, but depending on your score - you will get a response on how well you know Nada. There will also be a timer of 15 seconds per answer to keep it exciting. 


## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
